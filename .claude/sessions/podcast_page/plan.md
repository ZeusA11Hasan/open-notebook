---

## Implementation Notes

### Sequential Dependencies
- Phases 1-3 must be completed in order (foundation → sidebar → main area)
- Phases 4-5 must be completed in order (dialog → integration)
- Phases 6-7 can begin after Phase 5 is complete

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Phase 2 tasks (sidebar components) can be worked on in parallel
- Phase 6 tasks (edit/duplicate/delete) can be implemented in parallel
- Testing can happen in parallel with development within each phase

### Key Differences from Original Plan
- **2 tabs instead of single page**: Episodes tab preserved unchanged
- **Templates tab combines**: Episode profiles + speaker profiles in single interface
- **Reduced scope**: Less complex than eliminating all tabs
- **Lower risk**: Episodes functionality completely preserved

### Risk Mitigation
- Episodes tab remains completely unchanged (zero regression risk)
- Each phase maintains working functionality
- Rollback possible at any phase boundary
- Comprehensive testing prevents regressions

### Total Estimated Time: 12 hours (7 phases × ~1.7 hours average)
