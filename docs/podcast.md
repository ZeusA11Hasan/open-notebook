## ⚠️ Important instructions for Gemini

The new Gemini Text to Speech models are amazing and definitely worth using. But in order to use them, you need to do a little setup. Please refer to this [Podcastfy help page](https://github.com/souzatharsis/podcastfy/blob/main/usage/config.md) for details. But it basically requires you to enable the Text to Speech API and add it to your API Key.
