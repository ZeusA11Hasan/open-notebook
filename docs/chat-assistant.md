# Chat Assistant

Open Notebook's Chat Assistant provides an intelligent interface for interacting with your research notes and data. It can help analyze your content, answer questions, and provide insights while respecting your privacy preferences. The assistant leverages AI capabilities while giving you full control over how much context and information you want to share.

## Context Management

Privacy and control are at the heart of Open Notebook. With Fine-Grained Context Management, you have complete control over what information is shared with the AI assistant. You can choose to share no context, summaries only, or full content, allowing you to balance privacy, performance, and cost. This ensures that your interactions with AI are fully transparent and that you only share what you're comfortable with, maintaining both your privacy and the integrity of your research.

## Multple Chats

You can maintain multiple separate chat threads for different topics or research areas within the same notebook. Each chat maintains its own context and history, allowing you to organize conversations by subject matter, project, or any other criteria. This helps keep discussions focused and makes it easier to track different lines of inquiry or analysis.
