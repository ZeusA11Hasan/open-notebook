# AI Model Selection Guide

This guide helps you choose the best AI models for your Open Notebook setup. We'll cover what makes each provider special, which models work best for different tasks, and give you ready-to-use combinations to get started quickly.

## Understanding Model Types

Open Notebook uses four types of AI models:

- **Language Models**: For chat, text generation, summaries, and tool calling
- **Embedding Models**: For semantic search and content similarity
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: For generating podcasts and audio content
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: For transcribing audio files

## What to Consider When Choosing Models

**üí∞ Cost**: Some models are free (Ollama), others charge per token
**üéØ Quality**: Higher quality models often cost more but produce better results
**‚ö° Speed**: Smaller models are faster but may be less capable
**üîß Features**: Some models excel at specific tasks like tool calling or large contexts
**üß† Reasoning**: Newer reasoning models can show their thought process for transparent decision-making

## üß† Reasoning Models Support

Open Notebook fully supports **reasoning models** that show their thought process. These models output their internal reasoning within `<think>` tags, which Open Notebook automatically handles:

### How It Works
- **In Chat**: Reasoning content appears in a collapsible "ü§î AI Reasoning" section
- **In Transformations**: Clean output is stored while reasoning is filtered out
- **In Search**: Final answers are clean and focused

### Tested Models
We've tested extensively with these reasoning models:

- **DeepSeek-R1** (via Ollama) - Exceptional reasoning quality, completely free
- **Qwen3** (via Ollama) - Good reasoning capabilities with fast performance
- **Magistral** (via Mistral) - European alternative with solid reasoning

### Benefits
- **Transparency**: See exactly how the AI reached its conclusions
- **Trust**: Understand the reasoning behind responses
- **Learning**: Gain insights into AI problem-solving approaches
- **Clean Output**: Stored content remains focused and professional

### Getting Started
1. Install any reasoning model (we recommend starting with `deepseek-r1` via Ollama)
2. Use it like any other model - the reasoning interface appears automatically
3. Click the "ü§î AI Reasoning" expander to explore the AI's thought process

To use the OpenAI provider for audio: 
1. Use "gpt-4o-mini-tts" as the audio model name
2. pass the following Environment Variables
    - OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

### Gemini
To use the Gemini provider for audio: 
1. Use "default" as the audio model name (since vertex does not require a model name)
2. pass the following Environment Variables
    - GEMINI_API_KEY=gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts

### Google Cloud  / Vertex (previously supported as Google)

**If you were using this before, we recommend moving to GEMINI for better quality, price and ease of configuration.**

To use the Google Cloud (Vertex) provider for audio: 
1. Use "default" as the audio model name (since vertex does not require a model name)
2. pass the following Environment Variables
    - VERTEX_PROJECT=your-google-cloud-project-name
    - GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./google-credentials.json
    - VERTEX_LOCATION=your-google-cloud-project-location
3. Setup the correct permissions in the [Google Cloud Console](https://github.com/souzatharsis/podcastfy/blob/main/usage/config.md)
