# AI-Powered Notes

Writing notes has never been easier or more insightful with Open Notebook's AI-powered note-taking feature. You can write your own notes, or let the AI assist you by generating summaries, highlighting key points, or suggesting new insights based on your research materials. This feature allows you to save time while ensuring you don't miss out on important information, making your note-taking process both efficient and enriched by AI support.

## Creating Notes

There are 3 ways you can build your notes right now:

### Manual Notes

Inside any Notebook page, you will find a whole column dedicated to your notes. Just click the "Add Note" button, type a title and message and you are done.

### From an Insight

When you generate a Source Insight, you can easily convert it into a note by clicking the "Save as Note" button. This will automatically create a new note with the insight's content, which you can then edit or expand upon as needed.

### From the AI chat

If you are talking to the AI assistant and find a message that is useful to save as a Note, just click on the "Save as Note" button and it will be saved as a new note.

## A lot more coming soon

Notes are a very important part of the learning workflow and will be the focus of many of our new releases. One of the things we are working on is a Canvas-like interface for notes so that you can collaborate with the AI on the same piece of text.

We also plan to make this a real Zettelkasten workflow by enabling you to link notes, find similar ideias, and many other things.  If any any ideas of different useful ways to interact with your notes, please [let us know](https://github.com/lfnovo/open-notebook/discussions/categories/ideas).
